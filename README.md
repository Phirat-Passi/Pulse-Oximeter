# Synapse AI Thermometer Skin Temperature Sensor

Synapse AI designed and developed a transparent and flexible, capacitive thermometer using Smartphone embedded fingerprint sensor array with multiplexed, simultaneous detection of tactile pressure and finger skin temperature for mobile smart devices used for continuous measurement of body skin temperature. It is located under the Smartphone touch-screen and requires our users to firmly place their finger for evaluation process. This thermometer operates on networks of hybrid nanostructures using ultra-long metal nanofibers and finer nanowires, flexible electrodes of a multifunctional sensor array. These sensors exhibited excellent optoelectronic properties and outstanding reliability against mechanical bending. Designed Thermometer through Smartphone embedded fingerprint sensor array has a high resolution with good accuracy in monitoring skin-temperature, tactile pressure (used to predict fever), galvanic skin response (electrodermal activity, changes in sweat gland) and assessing the temperature condition of our patients remotely. This robust invention automatically initiates an alarm when the temperature reading comes out to be unusual over a prolonged period of time cautioning patients and doctors in advance about any health related complication.
