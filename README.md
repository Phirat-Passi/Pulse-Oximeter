#Synapse-AI-Thermometer-Skin-Temperature-Sensor
Synapseâ€™s fifth feature involves a transparent, flexible, capacitive thermometer using Smartphone embedded fingerprint sensor arrays that can detect multiplexed, simultaneous tactile pressure to measure finger skin temperature. 
The app uses instrumentation located under most Smartphone touch-screens and requires our users to firmly place their finger for the evaluation process. This thermometer operates on networks of hybrid nanostructures using ultra-long metal nanofibers and finer nanowires, flexible electrodes of a multifunctional sensor array. These sensors exhibit excellent optoelectronic properties and outstanding reliability against mechanical bending, which is why they are best equipped for the purposes of this feature. 
Upon testing, we found that the Smartphone embedded fingerprint sensor array has a high resolution with good accuracy in monitoring skin-temperature, tactile pressure (used to predict fever), and galvanic skin response (electrodermal activity in relation to changes in sweat glands). This robust invention automatically initiates an alarm when the temperature reading comes out to be unusual over a prolonged period of time, cautioning patients and doctors in advance about any health related complication.
